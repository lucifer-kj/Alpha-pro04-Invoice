# Make.com Webhook Setup Guide

## üîß Current Webhook Configuration

Your application is currently configured to send invoice data to:
```
https://hook.eu2.make.com/84agsujsolsdlfazqvco8mo06ctypst9
```

## üìã Make.com Webhook Response Requirements

For the application to work correctly, your Make.com webhook **MUST** return a JSON response with this structure:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "pdf_url": "https://your-storage-provider.com/invoices/invoice-123.pdf",
  "message": "Invoice generated successfully"
}
```

### Required Response Fields:
- `pdf_url`: The direct download link to the generated PDF invoice
- `status`: Either "success" or "error"
- `message`: Optional human-readable message

## üèóÔ∏è Make.com Scenario Setup

### 1. Create a New Scenario
1. Go to [Make.com](https://www.make.com) and create a new scenario
2. Add a **Webhook** module as the trigger
3. Copy the webhook URL: `https://hook.eu2.make.com/84agsujsolsdlfazqvco8mo06ctypst9`

### 2. Configure the Webhook Module
- **Method**: POST
- **Content Type**: application/json
- **Data Structure**: The webhook will receive the following payload structure:

```json
{
  "invoice_number": "INV-2025-01-15-123",
  "invoice_date": "Jan 15, 2025",
  "due_date": "Jan 22, 2025",
  "client_name": "Quality and Care Building Inspection",
  "client_address": "123 Cloud Drive",
  "client_city": "TX",
  "client_state_zip": "TX 94043",
  "client_email": "user@example.com",
  "client_phone": "+1 9042920103",
  "item1": "Web Development",
  "price1": "$299.00",
  "item2": "AI Chatbot builder",
  "price2": "$149.00",
  "item3": "Total Due",
  "price3": "$1.99",
  "subtotal": "$448.00",
  "tax_rate": "10%",
  "taxes": "$48.80",
  "total_due": "$496.80"
}
```

### 3. Add PDF Generation Module
Add one of these modules to generate the PDF:

#### Option A: Google Docs + PDF Generator
1. **Google Docs** module - Create document from template
2. **PDF Generator** module - Convert to PDF
3. **Google Drive** module - Upload PDF
4. **Webhook Response** module - Return PDF URL

#### Option B: PDF Generator Service
1. **HTTP** module - Call PDF generation API (e.g., Puppeteer, PDFShift)
2. **File Storage** module - Save PDF (AWS S3, Google Drive, etc.)
3. **Webhook Response** module - Return PDF URL

### 4. Configure Webhook Response Module
**CRITICAL**: Add a **Webhook Response** module at the end with this exact configuration:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "pdf_url": "{{pdf_download_url_from_storage}}",
  "message": "Invoice generated successfully"
}
```

## üß™ Testing Your Webhook

### 1. Test with Make.com's Test Feature
1. In your Make.com scenario, click **Run once**
2. Send a test payload to your webhook
3. Verify the scenario completes successfully
4. Check that the response includes a valid `pdf_url`

### 2. Test with the Application
1. Start your Next.js application: `npm run dev`
2. Go to the invoice creation flow
3. Fill out the form with test data
4. Submit the invoice
5. Verify you receive a PDF download link

### 3. Debug Common Issues

#### Issue: "Webhook did not return a valid PDF URL"
**Cause**: Make.com webhook response doesn't include `pdf_url` field
**Solution**: Ensure your Webhook Response module returns the correct JSON structure

#### Issue: "Failed to generate invoice"
**Cause**: Make.com scenario failed or returned an error
**Solution**: Check Make.com scenario logs and ensure all modules are configured correctly

#### Issue: PDF URL is not accessible
**Cause**: The PDF URL returned by Make.com is not publicly accessible
**Solution**: Ensure your PDF is uploaded to a public storage service (AWS S3, Google Drive with public sharing, etc.)

## üîç Monitoring and Logs

### Application Logs
Check your browser's developer console for detailed logs:
- Webhook request payload
- Response status and data
- Error messages

### Make.com Logs
1. Go to your scenario in Make.com
2. Click on the **History** tab
3. Check execution logs for any errors
4. Verify each module executes successfully

## üõ†Ô∏è Alternative Webhook URLs

If you need to use a different webhook URL, update the `invoiceActions.ts` file:

```typescript
// In lib/invoiceActions.ts, line 88-89
const response = await axios.post(
  "YOUR_NEW_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE", // Replace with your Make.com webhook URL
  payload,
  // ... rest of configuration
);
```

## üìù Example Make.com Scenario Flow

```
1. Webhook (Trigger) 
   ‚Üì Receives invoice data
2. Google Docs (Create Invoice Document)
   ‚Üì Uses template with invoice data
3. PDF Generator (Convert to PDF)
   ‚Üì Creates PDF file
4. Google Drive (Upload PDF)
   ‚Üì Uploads to public folder
5. Webhook Response (Return PDF URL)
   ‚Üì Returns: {"status": "success", "pdf_url": "https://drive.google.com/..."}
```

## üö® Important Notes

1. **PDF URLs must be publicly accessible** - Users need to download the PDF directly
2. **Response format is strict** - Must include `pdf_url` field exactly as shown
3. **Timeout is 15 seconds** - Make.com scenario must complete within this time
4. **Error handling** - Always return a proper JSON response, even for errors

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Make.com scenario execution logs
2. Verify webhook response format matches requirements
3. Test PDF URL accessibility manually
4. Check browser console for detailed error messages
