# ðŸ”§ Make.com Response Format Fix

## âœ… Issue Fixed!

The error you were seeing:
```
[INVOICE-ACTIONS] No PDF URL in response: Accepted
```

**Root Cause**: Your Make.com scenario was returning a plain string `"Accepted"` instead of a JSON object.

## ðŸ”„ How It Works Now

### Current Flow (Fixed):
1. **App sends invoice data** â†’ Make.com webhook
2. **Make.com responds** with `"Accepted"` (string)
3. **App now recognizes** this as `status: "accepted"`
4. **App starts polling** for status updates
5. **Make.com processes** the invoice asynchronously
6. **Make.com calls callback** with PDF URL
7. **App receives PDF** and shows download button

## ðŸ“‹ Make.com Configuration

### Option 1: Keep Current Setup (Recommended)
Your current Make.com scenario can stay as-is:
- **Webhook Response**: Returns `"Accepted"` (string)
- **HTTP Callback**: Calls `/api/invoice-callback` with PDF URL

The app now handles the string response correctly!

### Option 2: Improve Response Format (Optional)
For better clarity, you can update your Make.com **Webhook Response** module to return:

```json
{
  "status": "accepted",
  "invoice_number": "{{1.invoice_number}}",
  "message": "Invoice accepted for processing"
}
```

But this is **not required** - the current setup will work fine now.

## ðŸ§ª Test the Fix

1. **Submit an invoice** in your app
2. **Check the console** - you should see:
   ```
   [INVOICE-ACTIONS] Received string response, treating as accepted: Accepted
   ```
3. **Status should show** "pending" and start polling
4. **Make.com should process** and call your callback
5. **PDF should appear** when ready

## ðŸ“Š Expected Console Output

**Before (Error):**
```
[INVOICE-ACTIONS] No PDF URL in response: Accepted
```

**After (Fixed):**
```
[INVOICE-ACTIONS] Received string response, treating as accepted: Accepted
[INVOICE-FLOW] Invoice accepted for processing
```

The fix is now deployed! Your invoice generation should work correctly. ðŸŽ‰
