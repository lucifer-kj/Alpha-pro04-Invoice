# Make.com Callback Setup Guide

## üîÑ Enhanced Invoice Generation with Callbacks

Your application now supports **asynchronous invoice generation** with real-time status updates. This means Make.com can process invoices in the background and notify your application when they're ready.

## üèóÔ∏è Updated Make.com Scenario Setup

### 1. Webhook Trigger Configuration
- **Method**: POST
- **Content Type**: application/json
- **Webhook URL**: `https://hook.eu2.make.com/84agsujsolsdlfazqvco8mo06ctypst9`

### 2. Received Data Structure
Your Make.com webhook will receive this payload:

```json
{
  "invoice_number": "INV-1705123456789-123",
  "callback_url": "http://localhost:3000/api/invoice-callback",
  "invoice_date": "Jan 15, 2025",
  "due_date": "Jan 22, 2025",
  "client_name": "Quality and Care Building Inspection",
  "client_address": "123 Cloud Drive",
  "client_city": "TX",
  "client_state_zip": "TX 94043",
  "client_email": "user@example.com",
  "client_phone": "+1 9042920103",
  "item1": "Web Development",
  "price1": "$299.00",
  "item2": "AI Chatbot builder",
  "price2": "$149.00",
  "subtotal": "$448.00",
  "tax_rate": "10%",
  "taxes": "$48.80",
  "total_due": "$496.80"
}
```

### 3. Required Scenario Flow

```
1. Webhook (Trigger)
   ‚Üì Receives invoice data + callback_url
2. PDF Generation Module
   ‚Üì Creates PDF from template
3. File Storage Module
   ‚Üì Uploads PDF to public storage
4. HTTP Module (Callback)
   ‚Üì Calls your callback endpoint
5. Webhook Response
   ‚Üì Returns success status
```

### 4. HTTP Module Configuration (Callback)

Add an **HTTP** module after your PDF generation to call the callback:

**HTTP Request Settings:**
- **Method**: POST
- **URL**: `{{callback_url}}` (from webhook data)
- **Headers**: 
  ```
  Content-Type: application/json
  ```
- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "invoice_number": "{{invoice_number}}",
    "pdf_url": "{{pdf_download_url}}",
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Invoice generated successfully"
  }
  ```

### 5. Example Make.com Scenario Modules

#### Module 1: Webhook (Trigger)
```
Trigger: Webhook
Data: Invoice data + callback_url
```

#### Module 2: PDF Generation
```
Action: Create PDF from template
Template: Your invoice template
Data: Invoice data from webhook
```

#### Module 3: File Storage
```
Action: Upload PDF
Storage: Google Drive / AWS S3 / etc.
Settings: Public access enabled
Result: Public download URL
```

#### Module 4: HTTP Callback
```
Method: POST
URL: {{callback_url}}
Body: {
  "invoice_number": "{{invoice_number}}",
  "pdf_url": "{{public_pdf_url}}",
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Invoice ready"
}
```

#### Module 5: Webhook Response
```
Status: 200
Body: {
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Invoice submitted for processing"
}
```

## üîß Callback Endpoint Details

**Your Callback URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/invoice-callback` (development)
**Production URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/invoice-callback`

### Expected Callback Response Format
```json
{
  "invoice_number": "INV-1705123456789-123",
  "pdf_url": "https://your-storage-provider.com/invoices/invoice-123.pdf",
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Invoice generated successfully"
}
```

## üß™ Testing the Callback System

### 1. Test Callback Endpoint Directly
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/invoice-callback \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "invoice_number": "INV-TEST-001",
    "pdf_url": "https://example.com/test.pdf",
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Test callback"
  }'
```

### 2. Test Full Flow
1. Start your Next.js app: `npm run dev`
2. Create an invoice through the UI
3. Check the browser console for logs
4. Monitor Make.com scenario execution
5. Verify callback is received

### 3. Check Invoice Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/invoice-status/INV-TEST-001
```

## üìä Status Tracking

The application now tracks invoice status in real-time:

- **pending**: Invoice submitted, waiting for processing
- **generating**: Make.com is processing the invoice
- **completed**: PDF ready for download
- **failed**: Error occurred during processing

## üîç Debugging Tips

### Check Application Logs
```bash
# In your terminal running the Next.js app
[INVOICE-ACTIONS] Sending invoice to Make.com webhook...
[INVOICE-ACTIONS] Payload: { ... }
[INVOICE-CALLBACK] Invoice callback received: ...
[INVOICE-STATE] Updated status for invoice: INV-...
```

### Check Make.com Scenario
1. Go to your scenario in Make.com
2. Click **History** tab
3. Check execution logs for each module
4. Verify HTTP callback module executed successfully

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Callback not received
**Causes:**
- Make.com HTTP module not configured correctly
- Callback URL not accessible from Make.com
- Network/firewall issues

**Solutions:**
- Verify callback URL is publicly accessible
- Check HTTP module configuration in Make.com
- Test callback endpoint manually

#### Issue: PDF URL not accessible
**Causes:**
- PDF uploaded to private storage
- Incorrect file permissions
- Storage provider issues

**Solutions:**
- Ensure PDF is uploaded to public storage
- Check file permissions
- Test PDF URL manually in browser

#### Issue: Status not updating
**Causes:**
- Invoice number mismatch
- State management issues
- Polling disabled

**Solutions:**
- Verify invoice numbers match
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure polling is enabled

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Environment Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
WEBHOOK_URL=https://hook.eu2.make.com/84agsujsolsdlfazqvco8mo06ctypst9
```

### Make.com Production URL
Update your Make.com scenario to use the production callback URL:
```
https://yourdomain.com/api/invoice-callback
```

## üìù Benefits of Callback System

1. **Asynchronous Processing**: Users don't wait for PDF generation
2. **Real-time Updates**: Status updates via polling
3. **Better UX**: Clear progress indicators
4. **Reliability**: Handles slow PDF generation gracefully
5. **Scalability**: Can handle multiple concurrent invoices

## üîÑ Flow Diagram

```
User submits invoice
       ‚Üì
Create invoice status (pending)
       ‚Üì
Send to Make.com webhook
       ‚Üì
Make.com processes invoice
       ‚Üì
Make.com calls callback endpoint
       ‚Üì
Update invoice status (completed)
       ‚Üì
UI polls for status updates
       ‚Üì
Show PDF download when ready
```

This callback system provides a much better user experience and handles long-running PDF generation processes gracefully!
